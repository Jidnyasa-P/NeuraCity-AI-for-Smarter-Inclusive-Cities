## ✅ Verification Checklist

After opening the website, you should see:

### Homepage (index.html):
- [x] 3D city scene with glowing buildings in the background
- [x] Flying drones (cyan glowing spheres) orbiting
- [x] Data packets (green octahedrons) floating around
- [x] Buildings pulsing with light
- [x] Hero title "NeuraCity" on top
- [x] Animated city skyline in CSS (behind 3D scene)

### If 3D scene doesn't appear:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify `city3d.js` is in the same folder as `index.html`
3. Check internet connection (Three.js loads from CDN)
4. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Building Colors:
Edit `city3d.js`, find `createCityBuildings()` function:
```javascript
{ x: 0, z: -10, height: 15, color: 0x8B5CF6 }
//                                  ^^^^^^^^ Change this hex color
```

### Adjust Number of Drones:
In `createFlyingDrones()`:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  // Change 5 to any number
```

### Modify Animation Speed:
In `animate3DCity()`:
```javascript
drone.userData.speed = 0.01 + Math.random() * 0.02;
//                     ^^^^ Increase for faster movement
```
